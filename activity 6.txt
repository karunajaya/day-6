1.Solving problems using array functions on rest countries data

a.Get all the countries from Asia continent /region using Filter function

import requests

# Make a request to the REST countries API
response = requests.get("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all")

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON data
    countries_data = response.json()

    # Use the filter function to get countries from Asia
    asia_countries = list(filter(lambda country: 'continent' in country and 'Asia' in country['continent'], countries_data))

    # Print the names of countries in Asia
    for country in asia_countries:
        print(country['name']['common'])
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data from the API")

b.Get all the countries with a population of less than 2 lakhs using Filter function

import requests

# Make a request to the REST countries API
response = requests.get("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all")

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON data
    countries_data = response.json()

    # Use the filter function to get countries with a population less than 200,000
    countries_with_low_population = list(filter(lambda country: 'population' in country and country['population'] < 200000, countries_data))

    # Print the names of countries with low population
    for country in countries_with_low_population:
        print(country['name']['common'])
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data from the API")

c.Print the following details name, capital, flag, using forEach function

import requests

# Make a request to the REST countries API
response = requests.get("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all")

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON data
    countries_data = response.json()

    # Use the forEach function to print details for each country
    for country in countries_data:
        name = country.get('name', {}).get('common', 'N/A')
        capital = country.get('capital', ['N/A'])[0]
        flag = country.get('flags', {}).get('png', 'N/A')

        print(f"Name: {name}, Capital: {capital}, Flag: {flag}")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data from the API")

d.Print the total population of countries using reduce function

import requests
from functools import reduce

# Make a request to the REST countries API
response = requests.get("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all")

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON data
    countries_data = response.json()

    # Define a function to sum the population
    def sum_population(acc, country):
        population = country.get('population', 0)
        return acc + population

    # Use the reduce function to calculate the total population
    total_population = reduce(sum_population, countries_data, 0)

    print(f"Total Population of Countries: {total_population}")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data from the API")

e.Print the country that uses US dollars as currency.

import requests

# Make a request to the REST countries API
response = requests.get("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all")

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON data
    countries_data = response.json()

    # Use the filter function to get countries that use US dollars as currency
    us_dollar_countries = list(filter(lambda country: 'currencies' in country and 'USD' in country['currencies'], countries_data))

    # Print the names of countries using US dollars as currency
    if us_dollar_countries:
        print("Countries using US dollars as currency:")
        for country in us_dollar_countries:
            print(country['name']['common'])
    else:
        print("No countries found using US dollars as currency.")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data from the API")
